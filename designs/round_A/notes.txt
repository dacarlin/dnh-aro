# Biological sequence alignment 

1fcy is fine, has 1 extra residue (A) at beginning 

1qv0 is all fucked up. Missing MSSKYA at beginning (before V) and KDGS right in the middle of the protein 

1upv is missing the N terminal SQGSGEGEGV and a large chunk CNKRSFSDQPK that is not present in the crystal structure, this was added back into the designs 

1bvv has all residues in the biological sequence in the crystal structure 

1ukb is missing the initial methionine and 1 alanine MA from the N terminal end and NTPKLVGRP from the C terminus

1r5l is missing SPLL from the N terminal end and SIQ from the C terminus
