# De novo design of allyl hydratase enzyme

This repo is an example of **de novo** enzyme design using Rosetta. 

## Matching and scaffold set 

The matcher input files are in the root directory

## Enzyme design

The enzyme design files are in `enzdes/` and share some input files with the matcher (such as the constraint file and ligand params file)
